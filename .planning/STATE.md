# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-22)

**Core value:** Photos display reliably on the e-ink screen with correct colors, and the system just works after installation
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Pre-flight Hygiene

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Pre-flight Hygiene)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-22 — Roadmap created, ready to begin Phase 1

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Merge PR #3 before any module extraction — GPIO config dict will move to display.py; merge conflict surface grows daily
- [Roadmap]: Release Preparation (Phase 2) is independent of Module Extraction (Phase 3) — can be parallelized after Phase 1
- [Roadmap]: update.sh migration validated on real hardware as its own phase (Phase 4) — highest-risk deliverable, cannot be embedded elsewhere

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 (Migration Validation) requires access to a real Raspberry Pi with a v1.x installation for hardware sign-off. Plan for this before starting Phase 4.
- Phase 6 coverage gate (70%) achievability depends on how many hardware paths are excluded with `# pragma: no cover`. Validate after first test run before enforcing in CI.
